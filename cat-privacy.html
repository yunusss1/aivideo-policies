    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.</strong></p>
    <p>Games for Cats is designed with your privacy in mind. The App operates entirely on your device and does not collect, access, or share any personal information, including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Personal identification information</li>
        <li>Usage data or gameplay statistics</li>
        <li>Location data</li>
        <li>Device information</li>
        <li>Camera or microphone access</li>
        <li>Analytics data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
    <p>Any settings or preferences you configure in the App are stored locally on your device only. This data never leaves your device and is not accessible to us or any third parties.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, or advertising networks that would collect your data.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our App does not collect any information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. The App is safe for users of all ages.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>

    <h2>Camera and Microphone</h2>
    <p>While the App may use your device's camera or microphone for gameplay features, no video, audio, or images are recorded, stored, or transmitted. All camera and microphone functionality operates in real-time only for the entertainment of your cat.</p>
