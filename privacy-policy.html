    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: November 20, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to AIVIDO ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our AI video generation mobile application.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>Personal Information</h3>
    <p>We do NOT collect, store, or process any personal information. AIVIDO is designed with privacy in mind.</p>

    <h3>Authentication</h3>
    <p>We use Firebase Authentication for user accounts. Firebase may collect minimal authentication data (such as user ID) necessary for account functionality. This data is handled by Google Firebase and subject to their privacy policy.</p>

    <h3>Usage Data</h3>
    <p>We do NOT track your usage patterns, browsing history, or any behavioral data.</p>

    <h3>Crash Reports</h3>
    <p>We use Firebase Crashlytics to collect anonymous crash reports to improve app stability. These reports contain technical information about app crashes but do NOT include any personal or identifiable information.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>Your credit balance and video generation history are stored securely in Firebase Firestore, associated only with your anonymous user ID. We do not have access to any personal information linked to this data.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Firebase (Google):</strong> For authentication, database, and crash reporting</li>
        <li><strong>Google Play Billing:</strong> For in-app purchases</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These services have their own privacy policies governing their data collection and use.</p>

    <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>All payment processing is handled by Google Play Store. We do not collect or store any payment information. Your purchase history is managed by Google Play.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do NOT sell, trade, or share your data with any third parties. The only data sharing occurs through the third-party services mentioned above, which is necessary for app functionality.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our app is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data. However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Delete your account and associated data at any time</li>
        <li>Request information about data we store (which is minimal)</li>
        <li>Opt out of crash reporting by not using the app</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last updated" date.</p>
